# Short Course: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

### Acknowledgments
The Python code is from the short course "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" on the DeepLearning.AI platform, available for free.

### Description
This repository contains only Python code from my practice after each lesson.  
The original lessons are in Jupyter Notebook format, so I highly recommend signing in and watching the course for more detailed explanations and theory. You wonâ€™t regret it! ðŸ™‚

### Notes
- The original Jupyter Notebooks in the course are designed to run smoothly on the platform. However, this repository contains only the raw Python code from my practice sessions, without any additional dependencies or configurations.
- As a result, the code may not work immediately outside of the course environment without modifications. Please keep this in mind when running the scripts.
